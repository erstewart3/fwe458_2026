        "## What is Markdown\n",
        "\n",
        "Markdown is a simple method for writing content on the web using plain text—the same kind of text you already type every day. It relies on the regular alphabet along with a few common symbols, such as asterisks (*) and backticks (`), to add structure and emphasis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Compared to bulky word-processing software, Markdown files are easy to share across computers, phones, and between different people. Because of this simplicity and portability, Markdown is rapidly becoming a standard tool for academics, scientists, writers, and others. Popular platforms like GitHub and Reddit use Markdown to format posts and comments.\n",
        "\n",
        "Learning Markdown is straightforward and beginner-friendly. It doesn’t support advanced styling like font colors, sizes, or typefaces. Instead, it focuses on basic presentation, allowing you to create headings, bold or emphasize text, and organize content with lists in a clean, consistent way.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Objectives\n",
        "\n",
        "By the end of this course, students will be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Write **clear, structured scientific documents** in plain text\n",
        "- Document environmental data analysis workflows\n",
        "- Integrate **code, equations, and narrative**\n",
